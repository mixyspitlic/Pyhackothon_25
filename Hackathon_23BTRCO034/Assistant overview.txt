### **INTRODUCING BECK**

The virtual assistant represents a Python-based artificial intelligence system meticulously engineered to comprehend and interpret voice commands,
process them through multiple layers of analysis, and generate natural-sounding spoken responses. It seamlessly integrates speech recognition capabilities, 
advanced text-to-speech conversion, intelligent wake word detection mechanisms, and comprehensive web-based knowledge retrieval systems to empower
users with a completely hands-free interaction experience. The assistant continuously monitors audio input for a designated wake word, 
carefully analyzes and interprets the spoken input once detected, methodically processes the identified command through its decision-making pipeline, 
and generates contextually appropriate responses. To achieve this advanced functionality, it strategically utilizes Porcupine technology for reliable 
wake word detection, the powerful SpeechRecognition library for accurate voice input processing, the versatile pyttsx3 engine for natural text-to-speech 
conversion, and an array of external APIs including Wikipedia for comprehensive information retrieval. This version of Beck only works on the terminal of the
code.
